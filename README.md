## Has COVID-19 had any effect on the number of arrest by the NYPD?

## Overview
In this project I analyzed NYPD's records of arrest throughout 2020. I analzyed the number of arrest for each month, the number of arrest by race, and the number of arrest by Boroughs. To see if COVID-19 had any effect on the number of arrest by the NYPD I also analyzed 2019 and 2018 to see if there was a drastic change and to see if there were any patterns in the data.

During the George Floyd protest I have seen the NYPD arrest many protesters throughout the country and NYC. I was wondering if the number of Arrest had spiked up more than usual.
my hypothesis is that the number of arrest will be similare to 2019 but have spiked up during the summer.

## Analyzes of 2020

The number of arrest in 2020 is 140413. The fisrt thing that i noticed was that there was big decrease of arrest during the months January, February, March, and April. The reason why there was a deacrease could be because of COVID-19. COVID-19 was introduced in the beginning of the year and NYC was on lockdown. The second thing i noticed was the big spike on MAY this could be because the George Floyd protest were going on and many protesters were arrested during this month. Lastly, i was astonished that Arrests were increasing during the months of August, September, October, November, and December. I don't understand why Arrests increased during the fall and winter but usually arrest decrease during these months. In a article called 'Seasonal Patterns in Criminal Victimization Trends' they show how violent and household property crimes show how crimes are lower during the winter. But being arrested does not necessarily mean you were charged with a crime.

During 2020 Black people are more likely to get arrested than any other race. The second demographic that is likely to get arrested are Hispanics.

Was there a arrest disparity between different boroughs of NYC?
