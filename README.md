## Has COVID-19 had any effect on the number of arrest by the NYPD?

## Overview
My focus for this project is to show if COVID-19 change the number of arrest by the NYPD. The way I'm approaching this project is to analyze the number of arrest during 2020 and comparing that to previous years. With the analyzes that i made, i will conclude if arrest increase or decrease from previous years.

I analyzed NYPD's records of arrest throughout 2020, I looked at the number of arrest for each month, the number of arrest by race, and the number of arrest by Boroughs.

During the George Floyd protest I have seen the NYPD arrest many protesters throughout the country and NYC. I was wondering if the number of Arrest had spiked up more than usual. My hypothesis is that the number of arrest will be similare to 2019 but the number of arrest will spike up during the summer.

## Analyzes of 2020

The number of arrest in 2020 is 140413. The fisrt thing that i noticed was that there was big decrease of arrest during the months January, February, March, and April. The reason why there was a deacrease could be because of COVID-19. COVID-19 was introduced in the beginning of the year and NYC was on lockdown. The second thing i noticed was the big spike on MAY this could be because the George Floyd protest were going on and many protesters were arrested during this month. Lastly, i was astonished that Arrests were increasing during the months of August, September, October, November, and December. I don't understand why Arrests increased during the fall and winter but usually arrest decrease during these months. In a article called [Seasonal Patterns in Criminal Victimization Trends](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/spcvt.pdf) they show how violent and household property crimes show how crimes are lower during the winter. But being arrested does not necessarily mean you were charged with a crime.

During 2020 Black people are more likely to get arrested than any other race. The second demographic that is likely to get arrested are Hispanics. This is suprising because this disparity of arrests reminds me of the days of Stop and Frisk. Where the purpose of Stop and Frisk program was to target minorities and the effects are still lingering. Another reason why there is a disparity is because many communities that have a large number of minorites are being over policied.

[John DeCarlo, chairman of the Department of Criminal Justice at the University of New Haven's Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences, told ABC News that while he does not believe police target people for arrest based on race, he said officers often find themselves enforcing "overreaching laws" passed by legislatures that end up being biased against residents of economically disadvantaged communities.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/blacks-account-half-nyc-arrests-years-end-stop/story?id=71412485)

As of March 31, 2021, it is legal for adults 21 and older to possess up to three ounces of cannabis for personal use in New York. Adults may smoke or vape cannabis wherever smoking tobacco is allowed under the smoke-free air laws, with a few exceptions. [Before this law black people where 3 times more likely to get arrested than white people but the usage of marijuana where similar](https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/a-tale-of-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-in-the-era-of-marijuana-reform/).
If we just get rid of laws that target minorities we can change the disparity in arrest which can lead to communities trusting the policy more.

Brooklyn, Manhattatn, Bronx, and Queens had simialare number of arrests. But the only borough that had a big difference was Staten Island. This could be because the population of Staten Island is lower that the five boroughs so arrest are lower.

## Comparing The Number Of Arrest Of 2020 To Previous Years

I was surprised that the number of arrest decresed a lot during 2020. In the beggining of this project i thought that the number of arrest will be similare to 2019 but the number of arrest will spike up during the summer. There was a drastic decrease of arrest but there was also a spike during may.

Comparing the numbers of arrest during 2020 and 2019 there is a decrease of 214617 arrest (a decrease of 60.45%). 

Comparing 2020 to 2018 there was a decrease of 106360 arrest (a decrease of 43.10%)

One interesting thing that I saw when looking at the graph was that each year had a similare increase and decrease periods. For example, in the month of May and October there is a increase of arrest and during march through April there is a decrease.

Although cases are lower during 2020 the trend of Black and Hispanics being the top two races from being arrested are still there. This shows that NYC is not doing enough to close the disparity gap of arrest. As I mentioned before many communities that have a large number of minorites are being over policied.

what we see in this graph is that the trend of number of arrest are similare every year. Although the number of arrest are different all the boroughs have a similare number of arrest with the exception of Staten Island.
